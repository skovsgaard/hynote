# HyNote

This is a sample application showing how to build a simple web application using the Hy language with the Flask framework (without using the built-in `contrib.meth` module).

It uses TinyDB which stores its "database" as a regular JSON file. Given that TinyDB is essentially document oriented, this sample app should be possible to adapt for use with Couch, Mongo, or similar.
